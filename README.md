V2V communications use on-board dedicated short-range radio communication devices    
to transmit messages about a vehicle’s speed, heading, brake status, and other information to
other vehicles and receive the same information from the messages, with range and “line-ofsight” capabilities that exceed current and near-term “vehicle-resident” systems -- in some cases,
nearly twice the range. This longer detection distance and ability to “see” around corners or
“through” other vehicles helps V2V-equipped vehicles perceive some threats sooner than
sensors, cameras, or radar can, and warn their drivers accordingly. V2V technology can also be
fused with those vehicle-resident technologies to provide even greater benefits than either
approach alone. V2V can augment vehicle-resident systems by acting as a complete system,
extending the ability of the overall safety system to address other crash scenarios not covered by
V2V communications, such as lane and road departure. A fused system could also augment
system accuracy, potentially leading to improved warning timing and reducing the number of
false warnings. For a discussion of NHTSA’s views as to how the various levels of vehicle
automation will play an important role in reducing crashes and how on-board systems may
someday work cooperatively with V2V technology, see NHTSA’s Preliminary Statement of
Policy on Vehicle Automation (May 2013).3
